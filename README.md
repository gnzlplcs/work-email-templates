Chunks of codes to send work mails

Althought this is a very basic code, I've tested on Oulook, Thunderbird and some mobile devices. Nonetheless, it's free to be forked and improved.
I have to mmake mention to @stefanobg, whose code I used as reference. Link: https://github.com/stefanobg/email-template-generator.
